## <p align="center">Custom Python Modules</p>    
<p align="center"> Created by Damion V. Demeter</p>   

A collection of scripts that can be used as modules. Some useful, some completely aesthetic.

## Script List
1. custom_colors.py   
 * Color palettes because I am sick of looking them up per project. Ripped off the R idea of a dictionary, but corrected the colors.
 * Each is a dictionary. Currently available: 'wes_a' & 'contrasty' (contrasty unfinished).  
 * Usage:   
 ```
 import os,sys
 my_modules = os.path.expanduser('~/Dropbox/1_GITHUB_REPOS/my_modules')
 sys.path.append(my_modules)
 from custom_colors import wes_a

 # colors can now be called from the movie,
